# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for Debian SID hyprland. You can use them if you want. The system is still not too heavy, don't worry. My wallpaper is located at `~/Downloads/debian-motherboard.jpg`, you can download that too at [label](https://i.ibb.co/Chs7GhS/debian-motherboard.jpg). I use a blue theme, that looks a lot like tokyonight.
This configuration might not work on your system, make sure to read the files before using this, especially the ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf file.
